# Predicting-the-Capture-rate-of-Eye-Care-Practices-
<li>Performed Extensive analysis on the Dataset by using Unsupervised techniques like Clustering, Factor Analysis, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Correspondence Analysis to both empirically and theoretically understand the patterns in the data. </li>
<li>Principal Component Analysis is implemented for dimension reduction and Multiple Linear Regression is built to predict the Capture rates.</li>

<li>Performed Extensive analysis on the Dataset by using Unsupervised techniques like Clustering, Factor Analysis, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Correspondence Analysis to both empirically and theoretically understand the patterns in the data. </li>
<li>Feature Extraction technique such as PCA is performed for dimension reduction and Multiple Linear Regression model is trained to predict the Capture rates.</li>
